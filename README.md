# smart_parking_lot_classifier

This repo was created as a group effort of Vu Nguyen, Austin Smith, Hemil Patel and I to satisfy the requirements for our senior capstone course, Java Application Development. 

In this repo, you will find code created that utilizes machine learning algorithms, with the help of Tensorflow Lite, to monitor a parking lot and determine where the empty and occupied spaces are at.

The machine learning model was created to be deployed on a raspberry pi microcomputer.
